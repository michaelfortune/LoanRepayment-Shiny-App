Many people do not\r\nrealise that in order to reduce the loan period significantly, \r\na modest increase in monthly is all that is required. This \r\nshiny application allows people to do just that. You begin by\r\nselecting the intersset rate, amount of the loan and a typical\r\nrepayment period. This will calculate the monthly repayments\r\nand the total repayment over the chosen period. You can then adjust the repayment period down or up and instantly see the difference. By adjusting the values, one can easily see what the effect can be i.e how much you might save, or how much more you might be able to borrow if a longer repayment period is chosen.\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\n\r\nThe app is known as a shiny app and is hosted at shinyapps.io, by the people who developed RStudio. In terms of code structure, there are effectively two parts: a user interface (ui.R) and a server part (server.R). The ui provide the mechanism for entering the values, while the server part does the calculating of the payment and the rendering of the graphical output.\r\n\r\n## Application location.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the shiny app is hosted at shiny apps. The actual url is: (https://michaelfortune.shinyapps.io/LoanPayments)\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the application is shown below:\r\n\r\n![shinyapp] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelfortune/LoanRepayment-Shiny-App/master/Shinyscreen.png) \r\n\r\n## What exactly does it teel us?\r\n\r\nIf we examine the screenshot above, the main panel on the right shows \r\nthat for a loan of £100,000 over a 20 year (240 months) and an annual compounded interest rate of 1%, the repayments would be 240 payments of £460, totaling just over £110,000. Changing the repayment period to 15 years (180 month) results in 180 payments of £598, or a total of almost £108,000. In this particular case, there is little to be gained by reducing the period. The reason for this, is the low rate of interest:\r\n\r\n![shinyapp4] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelfortune/LoanRepayment-Shiny-App/master/Shiny100K1perc180.PNG)\r\n\r\n## What if the interest rates were higher?\r\n\r\nLet us examine what happens when the interest rates are considearbly higher e.g. 9% \r\n\r\nHere, for a loan of £100,000 over 20 years, the repayments would be 240 x 900 payments, or a total of almost £216,000 \r\n\r\n![shinyapp2] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelfortune/LoanRepayment-Shiny-App/master/shiny9_240.PNG)\r\n\r\nIf we reduce the repayment period is reduced to 15 years, the repayments increase to £1014 x 180 months and the total is reduced to  just less than £183,000.    \r\n\r\n![shinyapp3] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelfortune/LoanRepayment-Shiny-App/master/Shiny9_180.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the reason for the difference?\r\n\r\nOne main reason for the difference is that the capital is being paid off at an accelerated rate with each payment. Where the interest rates are low, there is little financial advantage in repaying a loan over a shorter period, but this changes markedly as interest rises.  \r\n\r\n## Let's look at the effect of a change in interest rate, by changing the value in the dropdown:\r\n\r\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\n\r\nshinyApp(\r\n  ui = fluidPage(\r\n  sidebarLayout(\r\n    sidebarPanel(\r\n      selectInput(\"r\", \"Select Annual Interest Rate here from the dropdown:\",\r\n                  choices = c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0))\r\n      ), ## end\r\n      mainPanel(plotOutput(\"distPlot\")),\r\n  )\r\n),\r\n\r\nserver = function(input, output) {\r\n\r\n  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\r\n    options(scipen=10)\r\n    int <- as.numeric(input$r)/1200\r\n    loan <- 100000\r\n    term <- 240\r\n    P <- (int * loan) /  (1 - ((1+int)^-term))\r\n    Payments <- seq(P, term*P, P)\r\n    plot(Payments, type=\"o\", col=\"blue\", xlab = \"Months\", ylab = \"Total Payments\")\r\n    title(main = paste(\"Loan Repayments (Rounded):\", term, \"payments x \", round(P,0), \" Total:\" , round(term*P,0)), col.main=\"blue\", font.main=3)\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the use of the shiny app will provide a useful means for people seeking loans, or otherwise managing long-term loans by providing an insight into the effect of increasing, or reducing repayments on the length of a loan and the amount of the toal repayment as well as the interplay of the interest rates. I trust that this was useful.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the shiny apps site and try it for youself.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
